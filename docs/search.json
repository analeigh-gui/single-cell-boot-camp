The PBMCs were grown for 24 hours in the presence of CD3/CD28 stimulation (“treated”) and compared to PBMCs grown for 24 hours in regular media (“naive”). Cells were then labeled with a 20plex AbSeq panel consisting of lineage markers and T-cell activation markers, as well as unique Sample Tags from the BD Rhapsody™ Human Single Cell Multiplexing Kit (resting PBMC: ST1; treated PBMC: ST2). The cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and processed using the BD Rhapsody™ Single-Cell Analysis System. Sequencing libraries for RNA and AbSeq antibodies were generated using the BD Rhapsody WTA Amplification kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease review the setup chapter to ensure that R packages are installed and the demo data (in folder “raw_data”) is downloaded.\n\n\n1.

So, please do block some time and try to digest the materials before attending the Boot Camp.\nIf you are familiar with R, you can skip the Precourse Preparation and jump to Chapter 1 - 9.\n\n\nFor further information, suggestions and bug report, please contact: biox_support_emea@bd.com\n\n\nDescription\nThe Single Cell Boot Camp: Analysis of scRNA-seq with R is to provide an overview of the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq using R. It is designed for early-stage researchers who want to adopt single-cell analysis in their toolbox. The workshop consists of theory in presentation and application in hands-on practice.\nThe workshop starts with a fast-paced training session on the common workflow of single-cell RNA-seq analysis, then continues with sessions on the common workflow of scRNA-seq using bioinformatics packages like Seurat.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nEach participant are expected to have:\n1. An introductory background in statistics, specifically in the below concepts: Median, log2 fold change, p-value, adjusted p-value, variance, PCA.\n2. Basic familiarity with R and tidyr package, specifically in the below functions: %&gt;% (pipe), filter, mutate, pivot_longer, pivot_wider, map, pmap, select, left_join.\nIf you would like to learn on your own with publicly available resources:\nChapter 1 - 4 from MordernDive.\n\nIf you would like to participate in an instructor-led R course:\nR for Biologist from Edinburgh Genomics. For details, please contact Edinburgh Genomics.\n\n\nExpected outcome\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be familiar with the following topics: Common workflow of single cell analysis (pre-processing, quality control, filtering, normalization, Clustering, Cell type annotation).\n\n\nReference\nThe building of materials for the course references and relies on many excellent and well written public avaialbe materials.\n\nSeurat https://satijalab.org/seurat/\nSingle Cell Best Practices: https://www.sc-best-practices.org/preamble.html\nOrchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/\nMary Piper, Meeta Mistry, Jihe Liu, William Gammerdinger, & Radhika Khetani.

    "text": "1.1 What is data frame\nData frame is data structure in R that store values of any type. You can think of it as a table with columns and rows storing the data as in below example.\n\nCredit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-frames/\nOften in data science language the columns are named as variables, the rows are observations and each entry in a table is a value.\nSome of the most common examples of input files that can be loaded into R as data frames are spreadsheets, TSVs, CSVs files. TSV and CSV stands for tab-separated or coma-separated values.\nAnother way to view data frame is as list of vectors of the same length. The vector can be defined as type of data structure that contains elements of the same type. Below you can find example on how create the table presented in Figure 1 from vectors.\n\n#define vectors which will create columns with data in data frame\n\n## Vector of names\nName &lt;- c(\"Avrey Bradley\",\"John Holland\",\"Jonas Jerebko\",\"Jordan Midkey\",\"Terry Rozier\",\"Jared Sullinger\",\"Evan Turner\")\n\n## Vector of team's names\nTeam &lt;- c(\"Boston Celtics\", \"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\")\n\n## Vector of values\nNumber &lt;- c(0.0,30.0,8.0,NaN,12.0,7.0,11.0)\n\n## Vector of positions\nPosition &lt;- c(\"PG\",\"SG\",\"PF\",\"PF\",\"PG\",\"C\",\"SG\")\n\n## Vector of age\nAge &lt;- c(25.0,27.0,29.0,21.0,22.0,NaN,27.0)\n\n#create data frame from vectors\ndata.frame(Name,Team,Number,Position,Age)\n\n             Name           Team Number Position Age\n1   Avrey Bradley Boston Celtics      0       PG  25\n2    John Holland Boston Celtics     30       SG  27\n3   Jonas Jerebko Boston Celtics      8       PF  29\n4   Jordan Midkey Boston Celtics    NaN       PF  21\n5    Terry Rozier Boston Celtics     12       PG  22\n6 Jared Sullinger Boston Celtics      7        C NaN\n7     Evan Turner Boston Celtics     11       SG  27"

The tibble type of table looks like a data frame but has some advantages over using regular data frames.\nFor example, while loading data as a classical data frame, the spaces in names are converted to periods or “x” before numeric columns is added. While using tibbles, the input names and data types remain unchanged. In this tutorial, we will work mainly with tibble data frame type."

The table contains the metadata of patients for which samples were processed on different single-cell platforms.\nThe example data required by this chapter is available at the precourse_preparation_data in Data.\n1.3.2 Loading data\nDepending on the input format, there are different dedicated libraries to load data into R. Here we start from excel spreadsheet and use function from readxl library. The readxl library is part of tidyverse package that will be covered in second chapter of this tutorial.\n\ndf_example &lt;- read_excel(\"data/precourse_preparation_data/mmc4.xlsx\", skip = 2)\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe two first rows in the original table are empty, so we skip them when loading.\nOne of the columns in excel spreadsheet is empty (column N). The R assign automatically the default name ..1 to that column and keep it within the data frame.\nAll the missing entries in rows will be filled with “NA” values automatically.\n1.3.3 Viewing the content\nThere are different ways to view the content of data frame.

To drop column, we chose all the columns (called by “colnames”) except (!=) “patient”.\n\nmodified_df_example &lt;- df_example[ , colnames(df_example) != \"patient\"]    # Drop column \"patient\"\n\nWe can also add columns into data frame. To add new column, use $ to indicate the column name for a new column as in the example below.\nHere we assign the values from already existing column to a new column. The new column is added at the end of the data table.\n\ndf_example$technology_type &lt;- df_example$platform # add new column named \"technology_type\" with values from \"platform\" existing column\n\nThe values from chosen column can be replaced with other values. In example below we search in df_example data frame in technology_type column for rows that contain “BD-Rhapsody” text.

We can make assumption that all cells with sum of counts lower then a threthold are low transcriptome cells and remaining cells are categorized as high transcriptome cells.\nThe if_else function with combination of mutate will help us to achieve the goal.\nFirst we need to know what is the structure of if_else statement. The first argument of if_else function is the hypotheses or the statement. We want to test if the counts for cell is below or above the threshold. Second argument is an action to perform if the statement is true. Third argument is an action to perform when the statement is false.\n\nIn our case, the hypothesis to test is if counts in a cell is below or above a threshold. We can set the condition to have a counts above 2000. If the counts are above the threshold the statement is true. When the statement is true the action is to set the label as “high_transcriptome”.

This allows to understand which genes are active or inactive in each cell and to identify different cell types based on their gene expression profiles.\nAntibody-Based Protein Analysis: You can use antibodies conjugated with unique barcodes to simultaneously measure the expression of specific proteins in individual cells. This enables protein-level analysis alongside gene expression.\nSample multiplexing with antibody-based techniques: involves using generic antibody conjugated with unique barcodes to label the cells for different samples. Each sample is labeled and idenfied with unique antibody barcode.\nImmune Repertoire Profiling: Rhapsody can be used for immune profiling, allowing researchers to analyze the diversity and clonality of T-cell and B-cell receptor repertoires. This is valuable for studying the immune response and identifying antigen-specific cells.\nAntigen-Specific T-cell Analysis: Immudex’s technology combined with the Rhapsody system, enables the precise profiling of T cells that recognize specific antigens, like viral epitopes or tumor-related antigens.

    "text": "2.3 From Sequencing Data to Expression Matrix\nThe analysis of sequencing data is handled by the software provided by BD to Rhapsody users that enables fast and easy data processing. In this chapter we will cover a key features of the pipeline and explain key concepts necessary to understand while working with single cell data.\n\n2.3.1 BD Rhapsody Sequencing Analysis Pipeline\nThe BD Rhapsody sequencing analysis pipeline is a series of computational and analytical steps used to process and extract meaningful information from the raw sequencing data generated by the BD Rhapsody system.\nThe goal of sequencing analysis is to transform text-based genomic data into numerical data, and we achieve this through a series of steps in our pipeline. The steps of the pipeline are listed in simplified graphics below.\n\nThe main steps of the pipeline include quality control of raw sequencing data, molecule counting, identifying the putative cells and sample of origin if multiple samples were processed in one experiment.\nCrucial Steps in the process are decoding the unique barcodes associated with individual cells and the information about gene expression. Additionally, we use a technique called Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) to count gene expression accurately. These steps enable us to precisely identify and quantify the activity of genes in each cell, forming the basis for further analysis.\n\n\n2.3.2 Expression Counts by UMIs\nUnique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are used to distinguish between molecules expressed in a cell by providing a way to count individual molecules accurately. Here’s how they work to differentiate and quantify molecules in a cell:\n\nAdding UMIs during RNA sequencing preparation: UMIs are small, unique sequences of DNA that are added to the capture sequences of the bead during the production. Each bead contains tens of thousands of unique UMI barcodes which are followed by the polyA capture sequence. During the cell processing, the polyadenylated molecules in a cell, as mRNAs are captured on the bead. Each UMI is specific to the molecule it’s attached to and become it’s unique tag (see Figure below).\n\n\n\n\nCreating copies of RNA molecules: After adding UMIs, scientists make many copies of all the RNA molecules in the cell by running PCR. This step ensures that there are enough copies to work with.\nSequencing the molecules: The copies of RNA molecules, including the attached UMIs, are then sequenced. Sequencing means reading the genetic code of these molecules to determine their identity.\n\nAnalyzing the data: When the sequencing is done, scientists look at the data. Here’s where UMIs become important:\n\nRemoving duplicates: Because UMIs are unique to each original RNA molecule, any duplicates (multiple copies of the same RNA molecule) with the same UMI are likely the result of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification during the sequencing process. Scientists can identify and remove these duplicates to get an accurate count of different RNA molecules.\nCounting unique molecules: By looking at the UMIs, scientists can count how many unique RNA molecules were originally present in the cell. This helps them understand which genes were active in the cell and to what extent.\nQuantifying gene expression: By counting the unique UMIs associated with each gene, scientists can measure the expression level of genes in the cell. Genes with more UMIs were more active in the cell, while genes with fewer UMIs were less active.\n\nIn summary, UMIs are used to distinguish between molecules expressed in a cell by providing a unique identifier for each original molecule. This helps in accurately counting and quantifying gene expression, which is crucial for understanding how genes function in single cells and studying cellular processes in detail.\n\n\n2.3.3 Output Files\nWe handle various types of data all at once during primary analysis. This includes data related to gene expression at first but can include as well protein expression or information about T-cell receptors (TCR), B-cell receptors (BCR), and sample tags depending on experimental part. The assays run during experiments determine what type of data will be generated and what output files are available for the users for downstream analysis.\nThe information about cells is stored in multiple output files. In below you can find summary of what output files relates to which information about the cell.\n\nThe primary analysis output files are taken as an input to secondary analysis. During the workshop we will work with data that include mRNA, protein and sample tag information. You will get to know how to load the expression matrice in MEX format for downstream analysis."

To integrate or not to integrate?\nThe goal of integration is to find corresponding cell states across conditions (or experiments). We want to identify cell types which are present in all samples/conditions/modalities within our dataset. We expect to observe a representation of cells from samples/conditions/modalities in every cluster.\nWe first look at how cells cluster without integration to determine whether integration is necessary. Integration is considered if cells cluster separately on samples/conditions/modalities, etc.\n\n# Run the standard workflow for visualization\nfiltered.rna &lt;- RunUMAP(filtered.rna, dims = 1:15)\n\nDimPlot(filtered.rna, group.by = \"Sample_Name\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nJudging by the UMAP, do the two samples need to be integrated?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same cell types from the two samples are not aligned. One may consider to perform integration.\n\n\n\n2. Perform integration\nFirst, we select the variable features. The features should be selected in each dataset.\n\n# split the dataset into a list of two seurat objects (treated and naive)\nsplit.filtered.rna &lt;- SplitObject(filtered.rna, split.by = \"Sample_Name\")\n\n# normalize and identify variable features for each dataset independently\nsplit.filtered.rna &lt;- lapply(X = split.filtered.rna, FUN = function(x) {\n    x &lt;- NormalizeData(x)\n    x &lt;- FindVariableFeatures(x, selection.method = \"vst\", nfeatures = 2000)\n})\n\n# Select the most variable features to use for integration\ninteg.features &lt;- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = split.filtered.rna, \n                                            nfeatures = 2000) \n\nNext, we perform the integration across samples. This step can take a while to run.\n\nanchors &lt;- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = split.filtered.rna,\n                                  anchor.features = integ.features)\n\nFinally, we can integrate across samples. By default, normalization.method is set to LogNormalize.\n\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- IntegrateData(anchorset = anchors)\n\n3. UMAP visualization\nAfter integration, we look at the integrated data on UMAP. To calculate UMAP, we need to first calculate PCA and select top PCs.\nMethods to select top PCs were used a lot more often when the data was normalized with LogNormalize.\n\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- ScaleData(integrate.filtered.rna, verbose = FALSE)\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- RunPCA(integrate.filtered.rna, npcs = 50, verbose = FALSE)\n\nElbow plot can help to select top PCs. The PC number, where the elbow is, is used to calculate UMAP.\n\nElbowPlot(integrate.filtered.rna, ndims = 50)\n\n\n\n\nFor this dataset, we use the first top 20 PCs. For other datasets, one may need to adjust the PCs according to the elbow plot.\n\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- RunUMAP(integrate.filtered.rna, \n                                  reduction = \"pca\", \n                                  dims = 1:10)\n\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- FindNeighbors(integrate.filtered.rna, \n                                        reduction = \"pca\", \n                                        dims = 1:10)\n\n\n# Plot UMAP                             \nDimPlot(integrate.filtered.rna, group.by = \"Sample_Name\")   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nChange the number of PCs and see how the UMAP changes.\nTips: You can change the PC numbers by dims argument in RunUMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nDimplot has many arguments to control the plots.\n\nSearch Dimplot in the “Help” tab and read the documentation.\nChange group.by to split.by. What is the difference?\n\n\n\nWhen we compare the similarity between the naive and treated clusters in the plots with or without integration, it is clear that this dataset benefits from the integration.\n\np1 &lt;- DimPlot(filtered.rna, group.by = \"Sample_Name\") + NoLegend()\np2 &lt;- DimPlot(integrate.filtered.rna, group.by = \"Sample_Name\")  + NoLegend()\n\np1|p2\n\n\n\n\n4.

The combined analysis of scRNA and AbSeq is so called “multimodal analysis”.\nSeurat package also provides the framework to analyze multimodal data. The framework is the the weighted nearest neighbors (WNN) approach, which enables simultaneous clustering of cells based on weighted combination of both modalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRNA profiling and protein profiling should be analyzed separately before combing for downstream analysis.\n\n\n1. Processing AbSeq\nWhen we analyzed the scRNAseq in the previous chapters, the dataset was filtered and only high quality cells are kept.

Due to the unspecific binding background signal of antibody, log-normalization doesn’t work well in AbSeq data.\nThere are 20 AbSeq in the experiment. We are going to use all of them as variable features.\n\n# switch the default assay to AbSeq\nDefaultAssay(combined) &lt;- 'AB'\n\n# set variable features\nVariableFeatures(combined) &lt;- rownames(combined[[\"AB\"]])\n\n# set a name for the dimentionality reduction to avoid overwriting\ncombined &lt;- NormalizeData(combined, normalization.method = 'CLR', margin = 2) %&gt;% \n  ScaleData() %&gt;% \n  RunPCA(reduction.name = 'apca', approx = F)\n\n2.

We specify the dimensionality of each modality (similar to specifying the number of PCs to include in scRNA-seq clustering). We use the same number of PCs as we did in previous steps.\n\n# run UMAP\ncombined &lt;- RunUMAP(combined, \n                    nn.name = \"weighted.nn\", \n                    reduction.name = \"wnn.umap\", \n                    reduction.key = \"wnnUMAP_\")\n\n# find clusters\ncombined &lt;- FindClusters(combined, \n                         graph.name = \"wsnn\", \n                         resolution = 0.4, \n                         verbose = FALSE)\n\nLook at the results in UMAP.\n\n# visualize the result in UMAP\np1 &lt;- DimPlot(combined, reduction = 'wnn.umap', \n              label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, label.size = 2.5, \n              group.by = \"predicted.celltype.l1\")\n\np2 &lt;- DimPlot(combined, reduction = 'wnn.umap', \n              label = TRUE, repel = TRUE, label.size = 2.5)\n\np1|p2\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare the UMAPs from RNA only and from WNN.

Clustering\nNow that we have our high quality cells integrated, we want to know the different cell types present within our population of cells.\nSeurat uses a graph-based clustering approach, which embeds cells in a graph structure, using a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph (by default), with edges drawn between cells with similar gene expression patterns. Then, it attempts to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’.\nWe will use the FindClusters function to perform the graph-based clustering. The resolution is an important argument that sets the “granularity” of the downstream clustering and will need to be optimized for every individual experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIncreasing resolution value leads to a greater number of clusters, which is often required for larger datasets.\n\n\nThe FindClusters function allows us to enter a series of resolutions and will calculate the “granularity” of the clustering. This is very helpful for testing which resolution works for moving forward without having to run the function for each resolution.\n\n# Determine the K-nearest neighbor graph\nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- FindNeighbors(object = integrate.filtered.rna, dims = 1:10)\n                                \n# Determine the clusters for various resolutions                                \nintegrate.filtered.rna &lt;- FindClusters(object = integrate.filtered.rna,\n                                       resolution = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6,  0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4),\n                                       verbose = F)\n\nThe meta.data has a separate column for each of the different resolution calculated.

It classifies functions in three aspects.\n\nMF: Molecular Function: molecular activities of gene products.\nCC: Cellular Component: where gene products are active.\nBP: Biological Process: pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products.\n\nThis chapter uses the differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells from last chapter as an example.\n1. Get Entrez ID\nclusterProfiler prefers the input of Entrez ID. We use biomaRt package to convert the gene symbol into Entrez ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nbiomaRt is handy to get information about features. You can use it to get gene symbols, genomic coordinates, transcript sequences, etc. You can explore what data is stored in biomaRt with listAttributes.\n\n\nThe differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells between naïve and treated PBMCs are stored in the matrix cd4t. The gene symbol in this list can be converted into Entrez ID by biomaRt.\nFirstly, connect to the Ensembl database and specify we want to retrieve information from the dataset of Homo Sapien.\n\nmart &lt;- useMart(biomart = \"ensembl\", dataset = \"hsapiens_gene_ensembl\")\n\n\nbiomart BioMart database connect to.

Along the x axis is the ranked genes. Each of the vertical line is one of those genes that are found in this gene set. Along the running line, you can see a lot of genes running together and it falls out when the gene becomes more sparse in the list.\n4.

You can think of it as a table with columns and rows storing the data as in the below example.\n\nCredit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-frames/\nOften in data science language, the columns are variables, the rows are observations and each entry in a table is a value.\nSome of the most common examples of input files that can be loaded into R as data frames are spreadsheets, TSVs, or CSVs files. TSV and CSV stands for tab-separated or coma-separated values.\nAnother way to view data frame is as a list of vectors of the same length. The vector can be defined as a type of data structure that contains elements of the same type.

By combining available assays, researchers can generate robust and intricate datasets to unlock powerful insights.\nGene Expression (scRNAseq): The primary purpose of scRNAseq is to measure the gene expression in individual cells. This allows to understand which genes are active or inactive and to identify different cell types based on their gene expression profiles.\nAntibody-Based Protein Analysis (AbSeq): You can use antibodies conjugated with unique barcodes to measure protein expression alongside with gene expression in individual cells.\nSample multiplexing with antibody-based techniques (SMK): Sample multiplexing kit (SMK) uses generic antibody conjugated with unique barcodes to label cells from different samples. This enables pooling of multiple samples on one cartridge.\nImmune Repertoire Profiling (Full length V(D)J TCR/BCR): Full length V(D)J assay profiles the diversity of T cell and/or B cell receptor repertoires. This is valuable for studying the immune response and identifying antigen-specific cells.\nAntigen-Specific T-cell Analysis (DCode): Immudex’s DCode technology enables the profiling of T cells that recognize specific antigens such as viral epitopes or tumor-related antigens. This expands the offering of immune profiling, aiding vaccine development and immunotherapy research.\nFrom gene expression profiling to antibody-based protein analysis, all assays can be combined or performed standalone to explore cellular functions and molecular dynamics in single cell resolution."

    "text": "2.3 Primary analysis - From Sequencing Data to Expression Matrix\nAfter sequencing, one will receive raw sequecning data. The raw sequencing data is usually in fastq.gz format. You may also see fq.gz.\nThe raw sequencing data is usually handled by the software, BD Rhapsody™ Primary Analysis Pipeline, to enables fast and easy data processing. In this chapter, we will cover key features of the pipeline and explain key concepts necessary to understand prior working with single cell data.\n\n2.3.1 BD Rhapsody™ Sequencing Analysis Pipeline\nThe BD Rhapsody™ Sequencing Analysis Pipeline contains a series of computational steps to process and extract meaningful information from the raw sequencing data generated by the BD Rhapsody™ Sinlge Cell System.\nThe goal of the primary analysis is to transform text-based genomic data into numerical data, and we achieve this through a series of steps in the pipeline. The steps of the pipeline are listed in simplified graphics below.\n\nThe main steps include decoding the unique barcodes and feature molecules associated with individual cells. Oftentimes, scRNAseq relies on unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to quantify feature expression.\n\n\n2.3.2 Quantify feature expression with UMIs\nUnique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are used to quantify featuer molecules in a cell. Here’s how it works:\n\nBead structure: UMIs are small, unique sequences of nucleotides that are added to the capture sequence of beads. Each bead contains tens of thousands of unique UMIs followed by the polyA capture sequence. Each UMI is specific to the molecule it attaches to and becomes its unique tag.\n\nThousands RNA molecule copies are created by PCR during library preparation.\nThe RNA molecule copies, including the attached UMIs, are then sequenced.\n\nUMIs can help to differentiate PCR copies and we can quantify correctly the feature expression. After sequencing, we count the number of unique UMIs rather than the number of reads of a transcript as the feature expression. UMIs help to:\n\nRemove PCR copies: Because UMIs are unique to each original RNA molecule, any duplicates (multiple copies of the same RNA molecule) with the same UMI are likely the result of PCR amplification rather than a true molecule.\nCount unique molecules: By looking at the UMIs, one can count how many unique RNA molecules are originally present in the cell.\nQuantify gene expression: By counting the unique UMIs associated with each gene, one can measure the expression level of that gene in a cell. Genes with more UMIs are more active, while genes with fewer UMIs are less active.\n\nIn summary, UMIs are used to distinguish real feature molecules from PCR copies by providing a unique identifier for each original molecule.\n\n\n2.3.3 Output Files from the Primary Pipeline\nThe primary pipeline produces many output files. Below you can find a summary of output files relating to different assays.\n\nThe output files from the primary analysis are the input of the secondary analysis. In the course, we will work with demo data that includes WTA, AbSeq and SMK. You will get to know how to load the expression matrix (in MEX format), how to perform quality control and other steps that are commonly included in single cell analysis in Chapter 1 - 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe course will ONLY cover the secondary analysis."

We generally consider these cells are low-quality cells.\nDarker cells: Cells with high mitochondrial percentage. Many of these cells have low gene counts at the same time.

    "text": "1.1 FindAllMarkers\n\nThis type of analysis is typically for evaluating a single sample group/condition. With the FindAllMarkers function, we are comparing each cluster to all other clusters to identify potential marker genes. The cells in each cluster are treated as replicates, and essentially a differential expression analysis is performed with some statistical test. By default, the test is Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.\nThe FindAllMarkers function has three arguments to determine if a gene is a marker gene.\n\nlogfc.threshold Limit testing to genes that show, on average, at least an X-fold difference (log-scale) between the two groups of cells. The default is 0.25. Increasing logfc.threshold speeds up the function but can miss weaker signals.\nmin.pct Only test genes that are detected in a minimum fraction of cells in either of the two populations. It is meant to speed up the function by not testing infrequently expressed genes. The default is 0.1.\nonly.pos Only return positive markers (FALSE by default).\n\nOne may change the arguments depending on how stringent to be.\nWe look at the marker genes in the clusters in sample “treated”.\n\ntreated.markers &lt;- FindAllMarkers(subset(filtered, subset = Sample_Name == \"SampleTag02_hs\"), \n                                  assay = \"RNA\",\n                                  only.pos = TRUE, \n                                  min.pct = 0.25, \n                                  logfc.threshold = 0.25)\n\nLet’s look at the top 2 significant marker genes in each cluster.\n\ntreated.markers %&gt;%\n    group_by(cluster) %&gt;%\n    slice_max(n = 2, order_by = avg_log2FC)\n\n# A tibble: 22 × 7\n# Groups:   cluster [11]\n       p_val avg_log2FC pct.1 pct.2 p_val_adj cluster gene           \n       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;          \n 1 2.21e- 39       2.43 0.394 0.096 6.23e- 35 0       LINC00861      \n 2 1.16e- 26       2.34 0.458 0.195 3.28e- 22 0       PDE3B          \n 3 8.15e- 37       2.79 0.306 0.107 2.30e- 32 1       RGS1           \n 4 5.57e- 87       2.10 0.605 0.22  1.57e- 82 1       MAL            \n 5 1.35e- 97       4.61 0.268 0.006 3.80e- 93 2       RAD54L         \n 6 1.24e-126       4.12 0.355 0.011 3.49e-122 2       UBE2C          \n 7 1.75e-104       6.29 0.267 0.006 4.94e-100 3       CX3CR1         \n 8 6.94e-200       6.29 0.507 0.014 1.96e-195 3       FCGR3A         \n 9 2.30e-  3       4.87 0.273 0.063 1   e+  0 4       TOX            \n10 8.67e-  6       4.77 0.273 0.034 2.45e-  1 4       ENSG00000225718\n# ℹ 12 more rows\n\n\nWe get a table with the information on marker genes.\np_val P-value before multiple testing.\navg_log2FC Log2 fold change on the average gene expression between one cluster and the rest of cluster combined.\npct.1 Percentage of cells expressing the gene in one group.

It classifies functions in three aspects.\n\nMF: Molecular Function: molecular activities of gene products.\nCC: Cellular Component: where gene products are active.\nBP: Biological Process: pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products.\n\nThis chapter uses the differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells from last chapter as an example.\n1.

We use biomaRt package to convert the gene symbol into Entrez ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nbiomaRt is handy to get information about features. You can use it to get gene symbols, genomic coordinates, transcript sequences, etc. You can explore what data is stored in biomaRt with listAttributes.\n\n\nThe differentially expressed genes in CD4+ T cells between naïve and treated PBMCs are stored in the matrix cd4t.

Clustering\nNow that we have our high quality cells, we want to know the different cell types present within our population of cells.\nSeurat uses a graph-based clustering approach, which embeds cells in a graph structure, using a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph (by default), with edges drawn between cells with similar gene expression patterns. Then, it attempts to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’.\nWe will use the FindClusters function to perform the graph-based clustering. The resolution is an important argument that sets the “granularity” of the downstream clustering and will need to be optimized for every individual experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIncreasing resolution value leads to a greater number of clusters, which is often required for larger datasets.\n\n\nThe FindClusters function allows us to enter a series of resolutions and will calculate the “granularity” of the clustering. This is very helpful for testing which resolution works for moving forward without having to run the function for each resolution.\n\n# Determine the K-nearest neighbor graph\nfiltered &lt;- FindNeighbors(object = filtered, dims = 1:20)\n                                \n# Determine the clusters for various resolutions                                \nfiltered &lt;- FindClusters(object = filtered,\n                         resolution = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6,  0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4),\n                         verbose = F)\n\nThe meta.data has a separate column for each of the different resolution calculated. We can look at how many clusters in each resolution.\n\nfiltered@meta.data %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(contains(\"RNA_snn\")) %&gt;% \n  map_int(~ unique(.x) %&gt;% length)\n\nRNA_snn_res.0.2 RNA_snn_res.0.4 RNA_snn_res.0.6 RNA_snn_res.0.8   RNA_snn_res.1 \n              9              12              15              16              17 \nRNA_snn_res.1.2 RNA_snn_res.1.4 \n             18              19 \n\n\n\nclustree(filtered, prefix = \"RNA_snn_res.\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that some clusters are very distinct and do not change with the value of resolution. On the right side of the tree, we see a single cluster that splits into the multiple clusters. The tree becomes messier as the resolution increases. There are nodes with multiple incoming edges. This is a good indication that we have over clustered the data.\nWe start with the resolution of 0.4. We assign the identity of the clusters using the Idents function to specify that we want to look at the clusters calculating with resolution = 0.4.\n\nIdents(object = filtered) &lt;- \"RNA_snn_res.0.4\"\n\n# UMAP visualization\nDimPlot(filtered,\n        reduction = \"umap\",\n        label = TRUE,\n        label.size = 6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nChange to other resolution values. How do the clusters change?\n\n\n2. Distribution of cells per cluster\nThe number of clusters are sensitive to the resolution. The demo dataset has PBMC and we expect each cluster contains cells from both samples.\n\nFetchData(filtered, \n          vars = c(\"ident\", \"Sample_Name\")) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::count(ident, Sample_Name) %&gt;%\n  tidyr::spread(ident, n)\n\n     Sample_Name    0   1   2   3   4   5   6  7   8  9 10 11\n1 SampleTag01_hs 1019   8  NA   8 327 286  68 62  NA 34 10 29\n2 SampleTag02_hs  216 653 608 345  11  11 178 71 111 59 47 NA\n\n\nWe can split the UMAP by sample.\n\n# UMAP of cells in each cluster by sample\nDimPlot(filtered, \n        label = TRUE, \n        split.by = \"Sample_Name\")  + NoLegend()\n\n\n\n\n3. Exploring known cell type markers\nWe can explore some known cell type markers to get an idea about the identity of clusters.\nSome typical cell type markers:\n\nCD14+ monocytes: CD14, LYZ\nConventional dendritic cells: FCER1A, CST3\nB cells: CD79A, MS4A1\nT cells: CD3D\nCD4+ T cells: CD3D, IL7R, CCR7\nCD8+ T cells: CD3D, CD8A\nNK cells: GNLY, NKG7\nMacrophages: MARCO, ITGAM, ADGRE1\n\nThe FeaturePlot makes it easy to visualize a handful of genes using the gene IDs stored in the Seurat object. We can easily explore the expression of known gene markers on top of our UMAPs. Let’s go through and determine the identities of the clusters. To access the normalized expression levels of all genes, we can use the normalized counts stored in the RNA assay slot.\n\nDefaultAssay(filtered) &lt;- \"RNA\"\n\n\nCD14+ monocytes: CD14, LYZ\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"CD14\", \"LYZ\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nB cells: CD79A, MS4A1\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"CD79A\", \"MS4A1\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nNK cells: GNLY, NKG7\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"GNLY\", \"NKG7\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nT cells: CD3D\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"CD3D\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nCD4+ T cells: CD3D, IL7R, CCR7\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"CD3D\", \"IL7R\", \"CCR7\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nCD8+ T cells: CD3D, CD8A\n\n\nFeaturePlot(filtered, \n            reduction = \"umap\", \n            features = c(\"CD3D\", \"CD8A\"), \n            order = TRUE,\n            min.cutoff = 'q10', \n            label = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n4.

You can think of it as a table with columns and rows storing the data as in below example.\n\nCredit: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-frames/\nOften in data science language the columns are named as variables, the rows are observations and each entry in a table is a value.\nSome of the most common examples of input files that can be loaded into R as data frames are spreadsheets, TSVs, CSVs files. TSV and CSV stands for tab-separated or coma-separated values.\nAnother way to view data frame is as list of vectors of the same length. The vector can be defined as type of data structure that contains elements of the same type. Below you can find example on how create the table presented in Figure 1 from vectors.\n\n#define vectors which will create columns with data in data frame\n\n## Vector of names\nName &lt;- c(\"Avrey Bradley\",\"John Holland\",\"Jonas Jerebko\",\"Jordan Midkey\",\"Terry Rozier\",\"Jared Sullinger\",\"Evan Turner\")\n\n## Vector of team's names\nTeam &lt;- c(\"Boston Celtics\", \"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\",\"Boston Celtics\")\n\n## Vector of values\nNumber &lt;- c(0.0,30.0,8.0,NaN,12.0,7.0,11.0)\n\n## Vector of positions\nPosition &lt;- c(\"PG\",\"SG\",\"PF\",\"PF\",\"PG\",\"C\",\"SG\")\n\n## Vector of age\nAge &lt;- c(25.0,27.0,29.0,21.0,22.0,NaN,27.0)\n\n#create data frame from vectors\ndata.frame(Name,Team,Number,Position,Age)\n\n             Name           Team Number Position Age\n1   Avrey Bradley Boston Celtics      0       PG  25\n2    John Holland Boston Celtics     30       SG  27\n3   Jonas Jerebko Boston Celtics      8       PF  29\n4   Jordan Midkey Boston Celtics    NaN       PF  21\n5    Terry Rozier Boston Celtics     12       PG  22\n6 Jared Sullinger Boston Celtics      7        C NaN\n7     Evan Turner Boston Celtics     11       SG  27"

The tibble type of table looks like data frame but have some advantages over using regular data frames.\nFor example, while loading data as classical data frame, the spaces in names are conversed to periods or “x” before numeric columns is added. While using tibbles, the input names and types remain unchanged. In this tutorial we will work mainly with tibble data frame type."

The table contains the metadata of patients for which samples were processed on different single-cell platforms.\n1.3.2 Loading the data\nDepending on the input format there are different dedicated libraries to load data into R. Here we start from excel spreadsheet and use function from readxl library. The readxl library is part of tidyverse packages that will be covered in second chapter of this tutorial.\n\ndf_example &lt;- read_excel(\"data/precourse_preparation_data/mmc4.xlsx\",  skip = 2)\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe two first rows in the table are empty and therefore skipped while loading.\nOne of the columns in excel spreadsheet is empty (column N). The R assign automatically the default name to that column and keep it within data frame.\nAll the missing entries in rows will be filled with “NA” values automatically.\n1.3.3 Viewing the content\nThere are different ways to view the content of data frame. The “View” function will take you to separate window where you see the table displayed and interact with it directly.\n\nView(df_example)\n\nThe “str” function lists directly in the console: the type of data (tibble), dimensions (322x18), columns with first values displayed and type of values.\n\nstr(df_example)\n\nClasses 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':   322 obs. of  18 variables:\n $ ...1                    : num  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...\n $ study                   : chr  \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" ...\n $ dataset                 : chr  \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020\" ...\n $ patient                 : chr  \"Adams_Kaminski_2020_001C\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020_002C\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020_003C\" \"Adams_Kaminski_2020_8CO\" ...\n $ uicc_stage              : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ tumor_stage             : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ sex                     : chr  \"male\" \"female\" \"female\" \"male\" ...\n $ ever_smoker             : chr  \"no\" \"no\" \"no\" \"yes\" ...\n $ driver_genes            : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ condition               : chr  \"non-cancer\" \"non-cancer\" \"non-cancer\" \"COPD\" ...\n $ age                     : num  22 25 67 65 66 49 62 57 66 20 ...\n $ platform                : chr  \"10x\" \"10x\" \"10x\" \"10x\" ...\n $ platform_fine           : chr  \"10x_3p_v2\" \"10x_3p_v2\" \"10x_3p_v2\" \"10x_3p_v2\" ...\n $ ...14                   : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ tissue: normal          : num  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ tissue: normal_adjacent : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ tissue: tumor_primary   : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ tissue: tumor_metastasis: num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n\n\n1.3.4 Extracting information\nExtracting data from an R data frame means to access its rows or columns.

To add new column, use $ to indicate the column name for a new column as in the example below.\nHere we assign the values from already existing column to a new column. The new column is added at the end of the data table.\n\ndf_example$technology_type &lt;- df_example$platform # add new column named \"technology_type\" with values from \"platform\" existing column\ndf_example[10, ncol(df_example)] #show all rows and last column\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  technology_type\n  &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 10x            \n\n\nThe values from chosen column can be replaced with other values. In example below we search in df_example data frame in technology_type column for rows that contain “BD-Rhapsody” text. For those values we assign “microwell-based”.\n\ndf_example$technology_type[df_example$technology_type == \"BD-Rhapsody\"] &lt;- \"microwell-based\"\ndf_example$technology_type[df_example$technology_type == \"10x\"] &lt;- \"droplet-based\"\n\ndf_example[10, c(\"platform\",\"technology_type\")] #display columns\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  platform technology_type\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          \n1 10x      droplet-based  \n\n\nThe last useful function to cover in this chapter is summary(). The function gives the statistical summary of each of the columns when applied on data frame. It can be applied on slice of data as for example only on one column or chosen columns and rows.\n\nsummary(df_example)\n\n      ...1           study             dataset            patient         \n Min.   :  0.00   Length:322         Length:322         Length:322        \n 1st Qu.: 80.25   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :160.50   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :160.50                                                           \n 3rd Qu.:240.75                                                           \n Max.   :321.00                                                           \n                                                                          \n  uicc_stage        tumor_stage            sex            ever_smoker       \n Length:322         Length:322         Length:322         Length:322        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n driver_genes        condition              age          platform        \n Length:322         Length:322         Min.   :20.00   Length:322        \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:56.00   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :63.00   Mode  :character  \n                                       Mean   :60.73                     \n                                       3rd Qu.:69.00                     \n                                       Max.   :90.00                     \n                                       NA's   :89                        \n platform_fine       ...14         tissue: normal   tissue: normal_adjacent\n Length:322         Mode:logical   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000         \n Class :character   NA's:322       1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000         \n Mode  :character                  Median :0.0000   Median :0.0000         \n                                   Mean   :0.2267   Mean   :0.3261         \n                                   3rd Qu.:0.0000   3rd Qu.:1.0000         \n                                   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000         \n                                                                           \n tissue: tumor_primary tissue: tumor_metastasis technology_type   \n Min.   :0.0000        Min.   :0.0000           Length:322        \n 1st Qu.:0.0000        1st Qu.:0.0000           Class :character  \n Median :1.0000        Median :0.0000           Mode  :character  \n Mean   :0.5497        Mean   :0.1398                             \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000        3rd Qu.:0.0000                             \n Max.   :1.0000        Max.   :1.0000                             \n                                                                  \n\n\n\nsummary(df_example$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

given twice in that case as an argument. The mrna_data is taken by mutate function as first argument and then in rowSums function as second argument.\nIn above example we used pipe to direct the mrna_data to mutate() function as argument. However the mrna_data was not forwarded by pipe to rowSums. For that reason we had to type it in the rowSums function. By default pipe operator forwards data only as first argument to a function. If you want the pipe to forward data as well as second (and next) argument to function you can use a dot.\n\nmrna_data %&gt;% mutate(counts = rowSums(.)) -&gt; mrna_data"

    "text": "2.6 if_else()\nThe if_else() function in R is a conditional function. It allows to test the hypothesis and perform actions based on answer.\nLet’s assume we want to label the cells according to transcriptom size. Based on threshold of counts we give a label of “low_transcriptome” or “high_transcriptome” for a cell status. We can make assumption that all cells with sum of counts lower then thousand are low transcriptome cells and remaining cells are categorized as high transcriptome cells.\nThe if_else function with combination of mutate will help us to achieve the goal.\nFirst we need to know what is the structure of if_else statement. The first argument of if_else function is the hypotheses or the statement. In our case we want to test if count for cell is below or above the threshold. Second argument of a function is an action to perform if the statement is true. Third argument of if_else function is an action to perform when the statement is false.\n\nIn our case the hypothesis to test is if counts in a cell are below or above the threshold. We can set the condition to have a counts above 2000. If the counts are above the threshold the statement is true. When the statement is true the action is to set the label as “high_transcriptome”. When the statement is false we set the label as “low_transciptome”.\n\nif_else(mrna_data$counts &gt; 2000, \"high_transcriptome\", \"low_transcriptome\") -&gt; cell_status\n\nIn that way we created a cell status for cells based on counts. We should see in a cell_status that was generated two labels. To verify if that is the case we can display unique values of a created vector.\n\nunique(cell_status)\n\n[1] \"high_transcriptome\" \"low_transcriptome\" \n\n\nIf we would like to add that

    "text": "3.1 Seurat Object Structure\nSeurat object stores information about the single cell multiomics data and the analysis that was done during downstream workflow. As we move through the workflow and make calculations, the results are added to Seurat object and stored in different “boxes”. Those different “boxes” are called slots.\nLet’s load the Seurat object into R. We will use the Seurat object that is created during workshop in first step, prior to proceeding with next analysis steps, as normalization, clustering etc.\n\nseurat.obj_00 &lt;- readRDS(\"data/precourse_preparation_data/example_seuratObj.rds\")\n\nLoaded Seurat object was created including mRNA counts table obtained from primary analysis. While Seurat object is generated the following information are added to Seurat slots by default: assays, meta data, active assay, active identity, project name and version.\n\nThe remaining Seurat slots highlighted in grey are empty and filled in with information while it is calculated over analysis."

The assay slot contains layers that stores ‘transformations’ of the data, including raw counts (counts slot), normalized data (data slot), and scaled data for dimensional reduction (scale.data slot)\nThe assays layers can be listed by Layers(). The layer content can be accessed by function LayerData. In example below we access the data layer from assay slot and display it as data frame.\n\nLayerData(seurat.obj_00, assay = \"RNA\", layer = \"counts\") %&gt;% \n  .[1:10, 1:10]\n\n10 x 10 sparse Matrix of class \"dgCMatrix\"\n                             \nA1BG      . . . . . . . . . .\nA1BG-AS1  . . . . . . . . . .\nA1CF      . . . . . . . . . .\nA2M       . . . . . . . . . .\nA2M-AS1   . . . . . . . . . .\nA2ML1     . . . . . . . . . .\nA2ML1-AS1 . . . . . . . . . .\nA2ML1-AS2 . . . . . . . . . .\nA2MP1     . . . . . . . . . .\nA3GALT2   . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\nIn current Seurat object we have one layer for active RNA assay\n\nLayers(seurat.obj_00)\n\n[1] \"counts\"\n\n\nAdditional layers will be added while analysis is done.
