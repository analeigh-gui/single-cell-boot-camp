The combined analysis of scRNA and AbSeq is so called \"multimodal analysis\".\n\nSeurat package also provides the framework to analyze multimodal data. The framework is the the weighted nearest neighbors (WNN) approach, which enables simultaneous clustering of cells based on weighted combination of both modalities.\n\n::: callout-note\nRNA profiling and protein profiling should be analyzed separately before combing for downstream analysis.\n:::\n\n# 1. Processing AbSeq\n\nWhen we analyzed the scRNAseq, the dataset was filtered and only high quality cells are kept. AbSeq dataset is filtered to have the same cells in.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='09_combining_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_9ac000d20c7c6266a9820f673ea61394'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get AbSeq from expMat\nab <- expMat$`Antibody Capture`\n\n# filter abseq data based on cell id from rna seurat object\nab <- ab[, colnames(integrate.filtered.rna)]\n```\n:::\n\n\nCreating a new Seurat object with AbSeq.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='09_combining_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_13d6d3bc74f056d25bb42d1723a4c4d1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a new assay to store AbSeq information\nab <- CreateAssayObject(counts = ab)\n\n# create a new Seurat object to store the combined analysis\ncombined <- integrate.filtered.rna\ncombined[[\"AB\"]] <- ab\n\n# Validate that the object now contains multiple assays\ncombined\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAn object of class Seurat \n40809 features across 4160 samples within 7 assays \nActive assay: RNA (19347 features, 0 variable features)\n 6 other assays present: integrated, refAssay, prediction.score.celltype.l1, prediction.score.celltype.l2, prediction.score.celltype.l3, AB\n 4 dimensional reductions calculated: pca, umap, integrated_dr, ref.umap\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we split the Seurat object by sample to normalize them separately.\n\nThe recommended normalization method for AbSeq is CLR, Centered Log Ratio. Due to the unspecific binding background signal of antibody, log-normalization doesn't work well in AbSeq data.\n\nThere are 20 AbSeq in the experiment. We are going to use all of them as variable features.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='09_combining_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_528c97ce5fb23c7ade49dc2b4adae16f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# switch the default assay to AbSeq\nDefaultAssay(combined) <- 'AB'\n\n# set variable features\nVariableFeatures(combined) <- rownames(combined[[\"AB\"]])\n\n# set a name for the dimentionality reduction to avoid overwriting\ncombined <- NormalizeData(combined, normalization.method = 'CLR', margin = 2) %>% \n  ScaleData() %>% \n  RunPCA(reduction.name = 'apca', approx = F)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 2.
