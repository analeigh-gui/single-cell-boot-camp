We have materials and RStuio setting up on the virtual machine, so you do not need to set up anything on the desktop for the course.\n\nHowever, if you are going to run through the prerequisites and the course chapters, please follow the instructions and set up RStudio on the desktop.\n\n**The learning outcome is much better if you go through the materials before attending the course from feedback of our previous students.**\n:::\n\n# 1. R and RStudio\n\nPlease follow the instruction to set up R and RStudio on desktop: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n# 2.

If you see this, **type \"a\" at the prompt and hit Enter** to update any old packages. *Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations.*\n:::\n\n1.
