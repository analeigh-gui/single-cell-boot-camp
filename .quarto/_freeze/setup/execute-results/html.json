We have materials and RStudio setting up on the virtual machine, so you DO NOT need to set up anything on your desktop for the course.\n\nHowever, if you are going to run through the Precourse preparation - R and the course chapters, please follow this chapter to set up R and RStudio on the desktop.\n:::\n\n# 1. R and RStudio\n\nPlease follow the instruction to set up the **most up to date** R and RStudio on desktop: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>\n\n# 2. Install R packages\n\n::: callout-note\nInstall the packages in the order listed below.\n\nThe package names are case sensitive.\n\nAt any point (especially if you have used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console **R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? \\[a/s/n\\]:**. If you see this, **type \"a\" at the prompt and hit Enter** to update any old packages.\n:::\n\n1.  Install the packages listed below **one by one** from CRAN using the `install.packages()` function.\n\n`install.packages(\"tidyverse\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"Matrix\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"RCurl\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"scales\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"data.table\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"readxl\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"Seurat\")`\n\n`install.packages(\"BiocManager\")`\n\n2.  Install the packages listed below **one by one** from bioconductor using the `BiocManager::install()` function.\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"AnnotationHub\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"ensembldb\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"SingleR\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"celldex\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"org.Hs.eg.db\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"clusterProfiler\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"AnnotationDbi\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"biomaRt\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"enrichplot\")`\n\n`BiocManager::install(\"muscat\")`\n\n3.  Check that all the packages were installed successfully by loading them **one by one** at a time using the `library()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='setup_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_6ad261295cc08812310c670f550ff33b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Seurat)\nlibrary(BiocManager)\nlibrary(Matrix)\nlibrary(RCurl)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(AnnotationHub)\nlibrary(ensembldb)\nlibrary(SingleR)\nlibrary(celldex)\nlibrary(org.Hs.eg.db)\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\nlibrary(AnnotationDbi)\nlibrary(biomaRt)\nlibrary(enrichplot)\nlibrary(muscat)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 3. Data to run the materials\n\nPlease access the folder [Data](https://bd1-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/yujuan_gui_bd_com/Documents/demo_data/data_for_boot_camp?csf=1&web=1&e=Q0QMU5) to download data to run the prerequisites and course chapters.\n\nYou will also need to download the entire repository as a .zip from <https://github.com/material-share/material-share-single-cell-boot-camp/tree/master>.\n\n![](pics/1-5-github.png)\n\nAfter download, unzip the repository and **put the Data folder in the repository**.\n\nTo run the analysis, double click on **single-cell-boot-camp.Rproj**. One should be able to bring the RStudio console.\n",
